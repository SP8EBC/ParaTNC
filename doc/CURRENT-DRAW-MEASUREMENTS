Yaesu FTH-2010 as a radio with 1W output power. All measured on B+ 12V line.
Current draw of GSM module depends on signal level. TX power of MS in GSM network is regulated
in closed loop by base station, so this measurement might not cover all cases. 
GSM uses GMSK modulation and that 125mA is only an average. Momentary peak 
when TX is keyed up might be way bigger (module itself can take up to 2A at 4V)


deep sleep: 1mA
GSM off, sensors off, radio off: 10mA
GSM off, sensors off, radio on receiving: 65mA
GSM off, sensors on, radio on receiving: 80mA
GSM on (idle GPRS/TCP not connected), sensor on, radio on receiving: 94mA
GSM on (idle GPRS/TCP connected 99mA), sensor on, radio on receiving: 99mA
GSM on (comm with network), sensors on, radio on recieving: 125mA
GSM off, sensors on, radio on txing: 650mA
