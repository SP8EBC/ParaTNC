if You see an error that libncurses.5.so library is missing please apply this solution taken from stackoverflow. The root cause is that in some 
newet system, like Ubuntu/Xubuntu 24.04 libncurses was updated to version 6.xx and the older one is no longer available

For Ubuntu 24 add to source list and then install:

    deb http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu focal-security main universe

    echo "deb http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu focal-security main universe" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ubuntu-focal-sources.list

    sudo apt-get update

    sudo apt-get install libncurses5
