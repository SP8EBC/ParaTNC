Supply voltage can be applied either by miniUSB connector or +5V pin in right header. Use both metods are not allowed and
can lead even to burning controler and/or power supply.

PC3 - PTT (default Open Drain)
PA4 - DAC Output - signal from controller to radio
PC1 - ADC input - signal from radio to controller. Schould be connected via 100nF in series capacitor and 10k-10k voltage
					divider to apply 1.65V (half od 3.3V) bias on ADC input
					
PA10 - UART RX
PA9 - UART TX	- This UART port of course work in TTL3.3V logic levels so You need MAX3232 or simmilar to connect to PC

PB6 - SCL to i2c pressure sensor
PB7 - SDA to i2c pressure sensor

PB9 - TX line from TX20 anemometr - brown wire in original cable
PB8 - DTR line from TX20 aneometr - green wire in original cable but it can be just permanently
									pulled down do ground via 1k resistor (ground is yellow wire in original cable).
									tx20 anemometr should be powered from positive 5V voltage 
									

PC6 - Dallas One Wire pin to DS termometer. Only one termometer can be used and it should be powered via separate +5V line,
		parasite power is not recommended. 
		
LEDS:
Blue LED - DCD - lights up while controller is receiving APRS packet from radio.
Green LED - If meteo is enabled this blinks when transmission from TX20 anemometr is correctly received. 
			In 'non-meteo' mode it works as TX indicator and lights up when controler is transmitting data.
